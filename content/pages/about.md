## Who am I?
I'm Richard Nguyen, an independent developer living in Winnipeg. I work on a handful of [projects](https://www.github.com/captain-chen/) that are sometimes quite useful. You can read about some of them [here](/pages/projects).

I've previously worked at <a href="https://kubra.com" rel="noreferrer">KUBRA</a> at the Missisauga location as both a client support programmer, where I maintained legacy and current applications used for billing purposes, and as a client solutions developer, where I worked on new projects with clients, designed and wrote applications to their specifications.

I raise a lot of plants, mostly the [carnivorous kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_plant), but recently started growing [microgreens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgreen) to eat. I do a lot of cooking and thoroughly enjoy the process from start to finish. I love reading, particularly stories with both an interesting premise and excellent world building. I also like playing the occasional video game.
