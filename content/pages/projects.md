## Projects
* [PDF Image Extractor](https://github.com/Captain-Chen/PDF_Image_Extractor) &raquo; I've created a small application that extracts and converts images from PDFs using the [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) library. It's quite useful for retrieving the original images instead of just taking a screenshot.
* [Internet Bots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) &raquo; I've written a handful of bot applications, most of which are now defunct, that connect to platforms such as Twitch and Discord to do interesting tasks such as:
    * [Scrape a website](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/index.html)'s product inventory for its most recent products then feed that information to a chat server.
    * An experimental multiplayer [incremental game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_game) where users work cooperatively to keep a fire going in order to ward off the cold and darkness.
    * Narrate text-based games where users can go fishing or enter a dungeon in a party of four where they must fight monsters in automated combat in order to acquire treasure.
* [Cellular Automata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) &raquo; I've toyed around with cellular automaton models, which is just a fancy way of saying make pixels move around on a grid based on a set of rules.  
See live demos below on my [CodePen](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/):
    * [Conway's Game of Life](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/full/MObVzE)
    * [Langton's Ant](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/full/zLYpzQ)
* [Roguelikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) &raquo; I've made some small tile-based movement games that use ASCII characters as its graphics. You navigate through dungeons and fight monsters.
    * [PyRogue](https://github.com/Captain-Chen/pyrogue)
    * [Roguelike in C++](https://github.com/Captain-Chen/rltutorial)

## Code
* [DFS Recursive Backtracking Maze Generator](https://codepen.io/captain-chen/full/wEavKo) &raquo; A visual representation I made of how a depth-first search algorithm may be implemented and used to generate a maze.
* [Emacs dot files](https://github.com/Captain-Chen/dotfiles) &raquo; My personal configuration file for use with [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) in [org-mode](https://orgmode.org/).
